# React Boilerplate

## Introduction

This react boilerplate is modified to meet the requirement for deploying on Decentralized networks like IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave, etc. We have added all the necessary modules, like react-router, to get you started with your react app without much effort.

This boilerplate is optimized explicitly for Spheron deployments, and we highly recommend using Spheron to ship your project. So GTFOL ðŸš€

> **_NOTE:_** You might have noticed that we are using HashRouter in this boilerplate. As the support of standard routing still needs to be added for most decentralized gateways, we recommend not removing this.
