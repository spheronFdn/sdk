# Browser Upload Server Example

- A express server that has one endpoint `GET: /initiate-upload`, that is used by the **client** project to get the `uploadToken` and to use it to upload data.
- All the logic is in the `index.js`.

To start the project:

1. execute `npm install`
2. create a `.env` file in the root and `SPHERON_TOKEN` variable, with the value of your Spheron API Token. To create the `token` that is used with the `SpheronClient`, follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token). When you are creating the tokens, please choose **storage** type in the dashboard.
3. execute `npm start`

After you start both the `client` and `server`, you can open http://localhost:3000 and upload data to the specified protocol.
