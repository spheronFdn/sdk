## Description:

- This package support uploading data directly from the browser without exposing you Spheron API token.
- To use this package, you would first need to initiate an Upload from your Backend service. To initiate the request you would need to send a post request to
  `POST: /v1/upload-deployment?project=<project_name>&protocol=<'ipfs'|'ipfs-filecoin'|'arweave'>&create_single_deployment_token=true` with your API Spheron token.
  The response of this request will include the id of the initiated deployment and also a single use token that can be used to upload data only for that deployment.
  Response would look like:

```
{
  "deploymentId": <deploymentId>,
  "singleDeploymentToken": <token that can be used only to upload data for the specified deployment>
}
```

After you get the `singleDeploymentToken`, you should return it to the browser and use it with the **@spheron/web-upload** to upload the data from the browser to the specified protocol.
