### Upload Example

In the example below you can see how to create an instance of `SpheronClient` and how to upload a file/directory to the specified protocol.

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

const client = new SpheronClient({ token });
let currentlyUploaded = 0;
const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks, cid } =
  await client.upload(filePath, {
    protocol: ProtocolEnum.IPFS,
    name,
    onUploadInitiated: (uploadId) => {
      console.log(`Upload with id ${uploadId} started...`);
    },
    onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
      currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
      console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
    },
  });
```

- Function `upload` has two parameters `client.upload(filePath, configuration);`
  - `filePath` - the path to the file/directory that will be uploaded
  - `configuration` - an object with parameters:
    - `configuration.name` - represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data.
    - `configuration.protocol` - a protocol on which the data will be uploaded. The supported protocols are [ `ARWEAVE`, `IPFS`, `FILECOIN`].
    - `configuration.onUploadInitiated` - **optional** - callback function `(uploadId: string) => void`. The function will be called once, when the upload is initiated, right before the data is uploaded. The function will be called with one parameter, `uploadId`, which represents the id of the started upload.
    - `configuration.onChunkUploaded` - **optional** - callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. the first one `uploadedSize` represents the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.
  - The response of the upload function is an object with parameters:
    - `uploadId` - the id of the upload
    - `bucketId` - the id of the bucket
    - `protocolLink` - is the protocol link of the upload
    - `dynamicLinks` - are domains that you have setup for your bucket. When you upload new data to the same bucket, the domains will point to the new uploaded data.
    - `cid` - the CID of the uploaded data. Only exists for IPFS and Filecoin protocols.

## Access Token

To create the `token` that is used with the `SpheronClient`, follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token). When you are creating the tokens, please choose **Storage** type in the dashboard.

## Notes

The package is only meant for Node.js environments and will not work in a browser or frontend apps.
